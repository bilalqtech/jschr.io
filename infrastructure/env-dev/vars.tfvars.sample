# create an account at https://www.mailgun.com if you don't have one

# if you don't want to wait 24 hours: https://app.mailgun.com/app/domains
#
# you can setup mailgun to forward all emails to another account (ie. gmail) using routes
# setup the route through the admin ui at: https://app.mailgun.com/app/routes

#   example catch-all route:
#       type: catch all
#       actions: [x] forward
